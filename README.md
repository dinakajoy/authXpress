# authXpress

AuthXpress is a robust and secure authentication system designed for modern web applications, with robust role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring secure and seamless user management. It offers essential features like user registration, login, forgot password, password reset, and refresh token management. With persistent login capabilities, users remain seamlessly authenticated even after refreshing the page. Users can also assign roles and permissions to users.

Built with a powerful Express.js backend and an intuitive React.js frontend, AuthXpress ensures a smooth user experience while prioritizing data security. Featuring hashed passwords, token-based authentication, and secure storage practices, itâ€™s a production-ready solution that integrates seamlessly into your application.
